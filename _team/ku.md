Benson Ku, MD, PhD is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine. He serves as an attending psychiatrist in the Achieving Recovery through Resilience, Optimism, and Wellness clinic at Grady, and provides clinical care for young adults experiencing first-episode psychosis. Dr. Ku is currently funded from the National Institute of Mental Health K23 Career Development Award to investigate the impact of neighborhood characteristics on neurobiology and conversion to psychosis among youth at high-risk. His research provides a novel integration of multiple levels of investigation including public health, geo-spatial sciences, neuroscience, and developmental studies in humans to discover novel targets for intervention both at the individual and neighborhood levels to prevent or mitigate psychosis.
