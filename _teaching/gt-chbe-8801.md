This course will address current and foundational scholarship and research in sustainability and sustainable systems. The course is open to graduate students from all Georgia Tech programs and will be co-taught by faculty from the Colleges of Engineering, Design, Ivan Allen, and Sciences. 

The course will emphasize core sustainability concepts, methods, and competencies at the PhD level, e.g. scholarship with which students pursuing a career in sustainability should be familiar.
