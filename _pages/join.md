I appreciate your interest in working with me. I receive a fair number of inquiries from prospective students and put together this page to provide more information.

  We seek students from all backgrounds.

- If you are an architect or urban designer, you will learn data/technical skills to effectively apply your domain expertise and build modeling and decision-making tools.
- If you are a coder or from a technical background, you will learn how your skills can help build tools to empower others to design and plan sustainable cities.

The students working with us typically go on to receive competitive offers at industry leaders such as Perkins&Will, Thornton Tomasetti and others, or go on to continue their academic journey at institutions such ETH Zurich, Cambridge University, NREL etc.

You can start working with us in a number of ways, depending on whether you are a Georgia Tech (GT) student or external to GT.

### External to GT

If you are external to GT and would like to join GT to work with me, I would encourage you to either apply for the [M.S. in Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/master-science-architecture), the [Ph.D. in Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/phd-architecture), or a [Ph.D. Program with ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/doctoral#degrees). Please note that admission decisions _are made by committees_â€”I, personally, _cannot_ admit you to any of our programs. I also _cannot_ assess how competitive your application will be before the deadline, as all applications are evaluated in comparison to the complete applicant pool.

In addition to submitting an official GT application, you are welcome to provide me additional information via [this form](https://forms.gle/YGa9cNqTumaREhF16).

### Student at GT

If you are a current student at Georgia Tech and would like to join my group, I ask you to complete one semester in my [Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)](/teaching/gt-vip-vyh/) before joining my lab.

Please refer to the official VIP program information on how to join my VIP as an [undergraduate](https://vip.gatech.edu/apply-undergraduate-students) or [grad student](https://vip.gatech.edu/graduate-students). There are options to join the class with 2-3 credit hours, depending on your level of seniority at GT. Students typically stay for [several semesters](https://vip-smur.github.io/team/25-Sp/) to take full advantage of the program. Funded assistantships are typically available after the first completed semester in the VIP with strong performance.
