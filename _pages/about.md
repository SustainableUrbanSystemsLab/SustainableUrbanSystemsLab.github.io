The Sustainable Urban Systems Lab, led by [Dr. Patrick Kastner](/team/) at Georgia Tech's [School of Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/) (SoA), focuses on developing innovative tools and methodologies for environmental performance simulation. Our mission is to empower urban decision-makers with software tools that place sustainability at the forefront of their profession. We contribute to the MS in Architecture [curriculum](https://arch.gatech.edu/high-performance-building-lab-curriculum) at the SoA with a program concentration in High Performance Building.
