Had a fantastic time at the Ecole d'Architecture de Marseille-Luminy workshop on the intensification of the Aixâ€“Marseille transect. 

Grateful for the exchange with Fabien Figueras and our students, and proud to share that our team earned a tied 3rd prize out of 13 teams with our project MÃ©tropoâ€™Loop! ðŸ™Œ

A special thank you to Prof. Jean-Marie Pincemin for the invitation and to the organizers around Prof. Julien Monfort and the other encadrants as well as the students for an inspiring two weeks in Marseille.
