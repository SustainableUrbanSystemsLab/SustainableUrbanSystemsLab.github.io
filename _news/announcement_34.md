[Sina](https://sustainableurbansystems.com/team/rahimi/) presented **“Comparative Modeling of Urban Microclimate and Outdoor Thermal Comfort: A Case Study of Georgia Tech Campus.”** We benchmarked the OpenFOAM-based **urbanMicroclimateFoam (UMCF)** against **ENVI-met** using on-campus measurements, and found that UMCF reproduced the diurnal temperature/humidity cycles more faithfully and did so with substantially shorter runtimes (≈8h vs ≈52h in our setup). These results strengthen confidence in high-resolution CFD for campus-scale design and feed directly into our **Outdoor+** workflow in Eddy3D.
