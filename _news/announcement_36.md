Weâ€™re excited to welcome Dr. Ä°lker KaradaÄŸ to our lab as a visiting scientist at the Georgia Tech School of Architecture!

Supported by a TÃœBÄ°TAK 2219 Fellowship, Ilkerâ€™s research focuses on applying machine learning to predict pedestrian-level wind conditions around buildings, advancing sustainable urban design and architectural aerodynamics.

Ilker was also recently recognized in the August 2025 update of Stanfordâ€™s science-wide author citation impact list, highlighting his contributions to architecture, building, and urban simulation research.

During his stay, Ilker will collaborate with our students and Patrick Kastner, strengthening international research ties and knowledge exchange.

Please join us in welcoming Ilker to the lab! ðŸ™Œ
