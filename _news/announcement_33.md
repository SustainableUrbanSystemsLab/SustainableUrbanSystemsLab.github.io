[Sina](https://sustainableurbansystems.com/team/rahimi/) published his **second** journal paper in *Building and Environment*. In this study, we validated the OpenFOAM-based **urbanMicroclimateFoam** solver against on-campus measurements at Georgia Tech, showing strong agreement for microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort. The work also lays the groundwork for the **Outdoor+** design tool in Eddy3D.
