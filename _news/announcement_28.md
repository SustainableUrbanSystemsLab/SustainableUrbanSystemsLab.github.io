[Sina](https://sustainableurbansystems.com/team/rahimi/) published his first Journal paper in Building and Environment. In the paper, we looked at the impact of including both convective heat and humidity in CFD-based microclimate models. 
Results show that neglecting these leads to significant prediction errors. Take a look [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389890731_Incorporating_Convective_Heat_Transfer_and_Humidity_Effects_in_Urban_Microclimate_Modeling_Should_we_care)!
