[Hang](https://sustainableurbansystems.com/team/xu/) presented his first Conference paper titled "Understanding Urban Building Energy Consumption with Explainable Machine Learning Approaches" in Hong Kong at CAAD Futures 2025 this week. In his work, we looked at the feature importance of non-geometric (think socio-econominc etc.) data sources and their feature importance for urban building energy modeling. It turns out, especially tree canopy data should be taken into account if the focus is on accuracy.

Take a look at the study [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b92tj622ejihjs3sdblnj/CAAD_Futures_2025_Sub_29_Revised.pdf).

Congrats, Hang!
