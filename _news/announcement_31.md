[Ze](https://sustainableurbansystems.com/team/jiang/) completed the HPC and Data Science Summer Institute, a week-long program hosted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, San Diego that brings together researchers across interdisciplinary backgrounds to explore advanced topics in high performance computing, machine learning, and GPU programming. After attending, he is excited to bring these skills back to the Sustainable Urban Systems Lab and develop a workshop on HPC Fundamentals for his fellow colleagues.

Congrats, Ze!
