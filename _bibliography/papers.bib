	abstract     = {Urbanization has a considerable impact on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and results in a negative impact on outdoor thermal comfort. In this context, vegetation can be an important lever in alleviating the UHI. Various types of sizes, and densities of vegetation offer different levels of cooling effects in the surrounding areas thereby enhancing thermal comfort. This paper assesses the impact of urban block layouts and varying vegetation densities on the urban microclimate specifically focusing on the regulation of humidity and air temperature. The objective is to determine how variations in vegetation types, densities, and sizes specifically influence the microclimate. We used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyze airflow patterns, temperature differences, and humidity levels in three different locations on a university campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The vegetation is modeled with different levels of porosity and sizes. The Leaf Area Density (LAD) is a measure that quantifies the leaf surface area in a given volume of vegetation. LAD affects the heat balance of the leaves which affects the surrounding temperature. The density of LAD determines the extent of shading and cooling effects through transpiration and absorption of solar radiation process. The higher the density would generally experience more shading and reduced temperatures, which is essential for regulating urban microclimate. The Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) is used to show the reduction in the temperature and thermal stress in and around the vegetation regions. The simulation will be investigated in a three-dimensional urban microclimate setting inside the Rhinoceros3d modeling software and carried out using the ‘urbanmicroclimatefoam’ solver in OpenFOAM. Trees are modeled as porous zones where LAD value is set to non-zero. Through this study we aim to propose guidelines for Sustainable analysts and Urban planners on the influence of vegetation in outdoor temperature and its impacts on local microclimate and neighborhood buildings.},

To understand the non-linear relationships between individual building energy demand, complex neighborhood context, and population factors at an urban scale, this study uses machine learning-based models of energy use combined with rarely-used geospatial data. In our case study area, we combine building footprints, tax assessments, and anonymized meter-level energy usage billing data provided by the local utility. We derive non-geometric information from tax assessment data that incorporates thermal systems, vintage, improvement records, demographics, and rural-urban definitions. We include geospatial features, such as the urban tree canopy (UTC) ratio, to capture microclimate impacts on building energy demand, driven by shading and evapotranspiration effects. We compare multiple machine learning models—including Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Random Forest (RF)—with respect to Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (MSE), and the coefficient of determination (R²). Results show RF outperforms other models, and partial dependence plots (PDPs) highlight the significance of UTC in shaping building energy consumption. These findings help prioritize model features for data-driven urban building energy modeling and emphasize the need to incorporate additional microclimate features in future studies.},

This paper introduces a fully automated, bottom-up UBEM framework that integrates LiDAR-derived 3D building geometry, tax and permit records, DOE and RECS-informed building templates, and utility data. Building models are generated and auto-calibrated using a computationally efficient 5R1C resistor-capacitor thermal model, augmented with a derivative-free optimization algorithm (BOBYQA) to minimize calibration error against seasonal energy billing data. Applied to the City of Ithaca, NY, the framework simulates over 5,000 buildings within minutes on a standard laptop, achieving sub-20% MAPE in calibrated zones. The model supports scenario-based analysis of electrification, envelope upgrades, rooftop PV adoption, and incentive schemes, incorporating detailed retrofit cost and payback calculations. This workflow demonstrates a scalable pathway for high-resolution, financially aware UBEMs suitable for deployment in small – to mid-sized jurisdictions with limited modelling capacity.},

Building on that, we present three increasingly ambitious decarbonization scenarios that offer a holistic perspective on Ithaca's future electrification potential. In automating the reconstruction of building geometry from readily available LiDAR data, along with automated BEM setup and calibration, our methodology offers a robust toolkit to plan holistic decarbonization efforts. We argue that our approach, which forecasts both UBEM and PV for all residential and commercial buildings within a single framework, provides insights that cannot be reached with siloed methods.

This has significant implications for ventilation, overheating, wind chill, and safety concerns such as down drafts from skyscrapers. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are the best practice for analyzing urban airflow patterns in design, they are computationally expensive and require a high level of expertise, making them underutilized in the early design process. This paper presents a surrogate model for CFD using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can process arbitrary building geometries. The model is trained using an automated end-to-end pipeline based on Eddy3D and implemented within the Rhino and Grasshopper environment as an Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)-based CFD-GAN predictor. This workflow provides instantaneous simulation feedback within the design software, reduces the risk of user error, and allows for appropriate spatial resolution in early design. The CFD-GAN has demonstrated promising accuracy, with a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)4 range of 75%–97% on a limited training dataset of 564 unique urban geometries. Although the model currently has limitations regarding accuracy in complex urban wake regions, we show that these are likely not of concern for outdoor thermal comfort analyses. While it cannot replace CFD in later design stages, the CFD-GAN facilitates the incorporation of urban airflow analysis in early design with minimal effort and instantaneous performance feedback.},

This study investigates how simulating the urban environment at increasing levels of physical accuracy impacts UTCI values along three cycling routes in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Baseline UTCI values are estimated using a local weather file, and the following increments in physical accuracy are considered: wind-scaling, shading from buildings, shading and cooling from trees, computational fluid dynamics simulations for wind speeds, and simulated surface temperatures. With bike ridership data from Bluebikes, Boston's bike-sharing program, the relationship between bike ridership patterns and UTCI values along each route is studied. Supervised machine learning models are applied to predict bike ridership based on UTCI and other predictors. UTCI simulation results show that incorporating the various increments of accuracy influences hopdfy UTCI values at urban areas and exposed areas differently. Incorporating local wind speeds is especially impactful for urban areas. The statistical models trained to predict hopdfy bike trip counts based on UTCI and other demand and weather predictors achieved a root-mean-squared error of 1.06 trips. 47\% of predictions were correct, and an additional 42\% of predictions were off by 1 trip. This study demonstrates the importance of spatial refinement in simulating UTCI, and motivates future research into efficient simulation methods or rules-of-thumb for deriving spatial-temporal UTCI values. Future work into building a robust predictive model would motivate the design of thermally comfortable environments for human-powered transportation in cities.},

  abstract     = {As work environments struggle to reopen during the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to establish practical decision-aiding tools. While a strong emphasis has been placed on determining generic guidelines to reduce the risk of airborne viral spread, there is a lack of free and easy-to-use simulation workflows to quantify indoor air quality and the risk of airborne pathogens indoors at a spatial resolution that can take into account floor-plan layouts, furniture, and ventilation inlet-outlet positions. This paper describes the development of a new, free, early design tool that allows designers and other stakeholders to simulate and compare viral airborne concentration under different indoor conditions. The tool leverages OpenFOAM-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and a passive scalar simulation approach to allow architects and interior designers to quantify airborne pathogens' exposure. The tool is integrated into the popular Rhino3d & Grasshopper CAD environment to facilitate its application in fast-paced design processes. We demonstrate good agreement compared to a CFD benchmark test. Further, we validate newly developed COVID-19 capabilities by comparing our results to an existing restaurant case study that included tracer gas measurements and validation using Fluent (Ansys). We demonstrate applications of the tool in a comparative study of a restaurant that investigates how plan and furniture layout interventions, ventilation strategies can impact the movement of airborne pathogens in indoor environments.},

  abstract     = {Outdoor thermal comfort simulation simulations rely on the mean radiant temperature (MRT) seen by pedestrians as an important input that remains difficult to compute. Especially for large urban models, computing relevant surface temperatures and radiation fluxes that make up the MRT is a daunting task in terms of simulation setup and the computational overhead. We propose a new algorithm to estimate exterior surface temperatures of building facades, roofs, and ground surfaces in an arbitrary urban 3D model. The algorithm discretizes all model surfaces and clusters them by material properties and sky and sun exposure to reduce computational complexity. The model setup is fully automated, and the algorithm is implemented in the popular Rhino3d CAD environment. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing both the resulting external surface temperatures against a high-fidelity simulation and the final MRT against real-world measurements. We report an RMSE of 1.8$\deg$C and 2.0$\deg$C, respectively, while reducing simulation times by a factor of 80. Envisioned applications of the algorithm range from rapid microclimate simulations in fast-paced urban design processes to large scale urban comfort evaluation of existing cities.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of awareness of health and well-being in cities, urban environmental analysis should expand from energy performance to new environmental quality-based considerations. The limited potential to annually evaluate outdoor thermal comfort, predominant among these considerations, has restricted the exploration of the interrelations between urban morphology and annual energy performance. This study aims to bridge this gap by capitalizing on the new capabilities of Eddy3D – a Grasshopper plugin which enables effective calculations of hopdfy microclimatic wind factors via OpenFOAM which in turn are used to generate annual outdoor thermal comfort plots. Using this method, a parametric study was conducted for different typology and density scenarios in three different hot climatic contexts in Israel. The automated analytical workflow evaluated a total of 60 design iterations for their energy balance, outdoor thermal comfort autonomy (OTCA) and self-shading levels using the shade index. The high correlation found here between the annual shade index and the OTCA, across all climatic contexts, shows the potential of the shade index to serve as an effective indicator, in these contexts, for comparative or optimization outdoor comfort studies. Further results are both the superiority of the courtyard typology in both energy and outdoor comfort studies, and the contrasting impact of higher density on the annual energy balance (lower performance) and outdoor thermal comfort (higher performance) in hot climates. The annual plots of both the energy balance and OTCA reveal various seasonal and monthly trends in the three different climatic zones which can lead to localized and seasonal urban design strategies.},
