  author={Rahimi, Sina and Berardi, Umberto and Stone, Brian and Kastner, Patrick},
  abstract={Significant advances in microclimate modeling tools range from no coupling to fully coupled urban physics, requiring a trade-off between simulation speed and accuracy. In this study, we validated the "urbanMicroclimate-Foam" solver for accuracy, an essential step for ensuring reliable modeling enhancements. This involved creating a detailed 3D model and conducting transient simulations, with results compared to weather data collected from on-site weather stations at Georgia Tech. Our future aim is to integrate this approach into the Eddy3D toolkit, enhancing its HAM and VEG modules for microclimate modeling. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of these methods in various scenarios and complex modeling tasks, contributing to advancing urban climate modeling. This work supports informed decision-making on the urban heat island effect and urban sustainability.},

  author={Rahimi, Sina and Kastner, Patrick and Berardi, Umberto},
  abstract = {Accurate microclimate data obtained through observation or CFD models is crucial for urban design and environmental improvements. Eddy3D is one of the tools widely used for simulating microclimate conditions. However, the tool currently lacks the incorporation of relevant urban physics into the simulation. The present research focuses on integrating the modeling of convective heat transfer and relative humidity within the Eddy3D wind module and unsteady state modeling. The study reports the approaches through simulations employing a simplified canyon model. The study site is the campus of the Toronto Metropolitan University in Toronto, Ontario. The simulation data is validated using real-time data collected from the weather station located on the roof of one of the buildings on the downtown campus. By comparing the simulated data with the real-time data, the study assesses the effectiveness of the new features and determines their appropriateness for integration into the Eddy3D tool. The findings highlight the adaptability and accuracy of the approach across various scenarios, effectively handling complex modeling to enhance the capabilities of microclimate predictions.},

  author = {Vangelova, Silvia and Kastner, Patrick},
  abstract = {The mass adoption of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) emerges as a promising solution for reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, using such systems to achieve net zero operational energy at the urban scale requires evaluating the solar potential of thousands of buildings which poses many challenges concerning data availability, quality, and privacy. To address these issues, we present an automated end-to-end framework for querying, combining, and processing publicly available aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Building Footprint data. Using open-source algorithms for geometry reconstruction and solar radiation analysis, we show how to estimate the maximum annual direct current (DC) electricity yield per building. This framework is designed to enable urban planners, developers, and architects to assess the solar potential of neighborhoods and cities in an accessible way. By enabling effective communication of results, it can help optimize resource allocation and benefit solar adoption initiatives.},

  author = {Maryam Almaian and Patrick Kastner},
  abstract = {As the global focus on sustainable building practices intensifies, architects face the challenge of designing structures that meet certain aesthetic and functional criteria while minimizing energy consumption. One critical aspect of achieving energy-efficient buildings is the selection of appropriate building materials with optimal thermal properties.The tools and software to simulate 2D heat transfer are available, but often limited in their set of features and cost-prohibitive. The limitations of 2D heat transfer are the inability to simulate and explore complex geometry, corners, and full building envelope analysis. The integration of 3D thermal performance analysis into the architectural design process is an even more complex and underdeveloped area. This thesis aims to address this gap by exploring the use of OpenFOAM to develop a user-friendly tool to simulate building-related heat transfer problems. The outcomes of this thesis aim to empower architects to make informed decisions about material selection, and their impact on energy efficiency, by seamlessly embedding it into the Rhino & Grasshopper CAD environment.},

Ithaca, NY, with its commitment to the Green New Deal, serves as a case study for cities confronted with these challenges. This paper explores how various building electrification scenarios might affect Ithaca's net-zero ambitions. We show that our reduced-order Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) approach can accurately predict building energy consumption and rooftop solar PV energy generation for the 6114 buildings in the City of Ithaca. Building on that, we present three increasingly ambitious decarbonization scenarios that offer a holistic perspective on Ithaca's future electrification potential. In automating the reconstruction of building geometry from readily available LiDAR data, along with automated BEM setup and calibration, our methodology offers a robust toolkit to plan holistic decarbonization efforts. We argue that our approach, which forecasts both UBEM and PV for all residential and commercial buildings within a single framework, provides insights that cannot be reached with siloed methods. In the future, we believe that the abundance of readily available urban data sets will allow us to transition our approach to other jurisdictions across the US.},

This has significant implications for ventilation, overheating, wind chill, and safety concerns such as down drafts from skyscrapers. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are the best practice for analyzing urban airflow patterns in design, they are computationally expensive and require a high level of expertise, making them underutilized in the early design process. This paper presents a surrogate model for CFD using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can process arbitrary building geometries. The model is trained using an automated end-to-end pipeline based on Eddy3D and implemented within the Rhino and Grasshopper environment as an Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)-based CFD-GAN predictor. This workflow provides instantaneous simulation feedback within the design software, reduces the risk of user error, and allows for appropriate spatial resolution in early design. The CFD-GAN has demonstrated promising accuracy, with a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)4 range of 75%–97% on a limited training dataset of 564 unique urban geometries. Although the model currently has limitations regarding accuracy in complex urban wake regions, we show that these are likely not of concern for outdoor thermal comfort analyses. While it cannot replace CFD in later design stages, the CFD-GAN facilitates the incorporation of urban airflow analysis in early design with minimal effort and instantaneous performance feedback.},

We motivate the decoupled systems framework with meteorological measurements and local and global sensitivity analyses of three different climates. For a real-world case study on a university campus, we present results for both wind velocity and mean radiant temperature simulations. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a decoupled simulation approach considering design aiding and the architectural community. Our findings support reduced simulation time and flexibility, with the caveat of reduced accuracy due to neglecting forced convection, albeit this being less relevant in the early stages of design.

This study investigates how simulating the urban environment at increasing levels of physical accuracy impacts UTCI values along three cycling routes in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Baseline UTCI values are estimated using a local weather file, and the following increments in physical accuracy are considered: wind-scaling, shading from buildings, shading and cooling from trees, computational fluid dynamics simulations for wind speeds, and simulated surface temperatures. With bike ridership data from Bluebikes, Boston's bike-sharing program, the relationship between bike ridership patterns and UTCI values along each route is studied. Supervised machine learning models are applied to predict bike ridership based on UTCI and other predictors. UTCI simulation results show that incorporating the various increments of accuracy influences hourly UTCI values at urban areas and exposed areas differently. Incorporating local wind speeds is especially impactful for urban areas. The statistical models trained to predict hourly bike trip counts based on UTCI and other demand and weather predictors achieved a root-mean-squared error of 1.06 trips. 47\% of predictions were correct, and an additional 42\% of predictions were off by 1 trip. This study demonstrates the importance of spatial refinement in simulating UTCI, and motivates future research into efficient simulation methods or rules-of-thumb for deriving spatial-temporal UTCI values. Future work into building a robust predictive model would motivate the design of thermally comfortable environments for human-powered transportation in cities.},

This paper describes the development of a new, free, early design tool that allows designers and other stakeholders to simulate and compare viral airborne concentration under different indoor conditions. The tool leverages OpenFOAM-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and a passive scalar simulation approach to allow architects and interior designers to quantify airborne pathogens' exposure. The tool is integrated into the popular Rhino3d & Grasshopper CAD environment to facilitate its application in fast-paced design processes. We demonstrate good agreement compared to a CFD benchmark test. Further, we validate newly developed COVID-19 capabilities by comparing our results to an existing restaurant case study that included tracer gas measurements and validation using Fluent (Ansys). We demonstrate applications of the tool in a comparative study of a restaurant that investigates how plan and furniture layout interventions, ventilation strategies can impact the movement of airborne pathogens in indoor environments.},

We propose a new algorithm to estimate exterior surface temperatures of building facades, roofs, and ground surfaces in an arbitrary urban 3D model. The algorithm discretizes all model surfaces and clusters them by material properties and sky and sun exposure to reduce computational complexity. The model setup is fully automated, and the algorithm is implemented in the popular Rhino3d CAD environment. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing both the resulting external surface temperatures against a high-fidelity simulation and the final MRT against real-world measurements. We report an RMSE of 1.8$\deg$C and 2.0$\deg$C, respectively, while reducing simulation times by a factor of 80.

  abstract          = {Although recent advancements in computational architecture show promising capabilities, it remains difficult for architects to conduct advanced simulations due to the limited software interoperability. For thermal bridging analyses, the architectural community traditionally relies on specific software tools that are not integrated into a CAD environment. To integrate such analyses into the ongoing design process, we implement a software tool to run heat transfer simulations with OpenFOAM from Grasshopper and Rhinoceros. This paper presents an implementation for box-shaped geometries and compares its results to a thermal bridge analysis from a validated simulation engine. We show that OpenFOAM's chtMultiregionFoam solver is capable of accurately predicting temperature distributions in a geometry setup with 13 different regions and 8 different materials. In conclusion, we show that heat transfer studies can be highly automated and integrated into an iterative design process.},

  abstract          = {With the rise of awareness of health and well-being in cities, urban environmental analysis should expand from energy performance to new environmental quality-based considerations. The limited potential to annually evaluate outdoor thermal comfort, predominant among these considerations, has restricted the exploration of the interrelations between urban morphology and annual energy performance. This study aims to bridge this gap by capitalizing on the new capabilities of Eddy3D – a Grasshopper plugin which enables effective calculations of hourly microclimatic wind factors via OpenFOAM which in turn are used to generate annual outdoor thermal comfort plots. Using this method, a parametric study was conducted for different typology and density scenarios in three different hot climatic contexts in Israel. The automated analytical workflow evaluated a total of 60 design iterations for their energy balance, outdoor thermal comfort autonomy (OTCA) and self-shading levels using the shade index. The high correlation found here between the annual shade index and the OTCA, across all climatic contexts, shows the potential of the shade index to serve as an effective indicator, in these contexts, for comparative or optimization outdoor comfort studies. Further results are both the superiority of the courtyard typology in both energy and outdoor comfort studies, and the contrasting impact of higher density on the annual energy balance (lower performance) and outdoor thermal comfort (higher performance) in hot climates. The annual plots of both the energy balance and OTCA reveal various seasonal and monthly trends in the three different climatic zones which can lead to localized and seasonal urban design strategies.},

These approaches rely on pressure coefficient arrays representing different wind directions derived from simple box-shaped buildings without contextual obstructions.

In this study, we present an automated and easy-to-use simulation workflow for OpenFOAM-based exterior airflow simulations to generate pressure coefficient arrays for arbitrary building shapes and contextual situations. The workflow is compared to other methods commonly used to obtain pressure coefficients for natural ventilation analysis. Finally, we assess for which climate zones and building types modelers should rely on more accurate CFD-based pressure coefficients and where it may be justifiable to rely on easier and readily available analytical approaches to determine pressure coefficients. Results suggest that existing workflows lead to significant error in predicted comfort hours for climates in the global South and modelers should consider CFD based façade pressure coefficient.},
